First time Installs
-------------------

dovecot-imapd will not actually start up until the protocols= line in 
/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf contains one or both of the keywords imap (for
IMAP4rev1 on standard port 143) or imaps (for IMAP4rev1 over SSL on standard 
port 993.)

After making the change, do: 

  # /etc/init.d/dovecot restart 

to enable imapd.

Compile
-------

Prerequisites:
	* A patched and compiled dovecot-1.1 tree:
		To enable support for the new managesieve service, Dovecot needs to be 
		patched. The patch is available from the same source as this package. 
		
		Package and patch are named as follows:
		  Patch: dovecot-1.1.X-managesieve-<managesieve version>.diff.gz
		  Package: dovecot-1.1-managesieve-<managesieve version>.tar.gz
		
		Nothing special needs to be done to compile the patched tree. You can use:
			./configure
			make
			sudo make install
		as usual. 
		
		Note that this package will compile against an unpatched dovecot tree, but 
		keep in mind that dovecot will not know about managesieve without the patch.

	* A compiled dovecot-sieve-1.1 tree. 
		Currently, no special version dependencies are known to compile against the
		sieve plugin, but of course the most recent version is recommended. 

If you downloaded this package using Mercurial, you have a script called 
autogen.sh in your source tree. You should execute that first:

./autogen.sh

After this executed successfully or when you downloaded the tarball,
configure needs to be executed with the following parameters:

	--with-dovecot=<path>
		Path to the patched and compiled dovecot-1.1 source tree
	--with-dovecot-sieve=<path>	
		Path to the compiled dovecot-sieve-1.1 source tree

For example:

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-1.1 \
	--with-dovecot-sieve=../dovecot-sieve-1.1

As usual, to compile and install, execute the following:

make
sudo make install

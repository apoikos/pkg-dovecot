Design
------

The overall design of the daemon is entirely borrowed from the existing
imap daemon. I have tried to apply the dovecot framework and programming
paradigms as much as possible. This package contains the following
directories:

lib-managesieve: parser and quote functions (bound to disappear)
lib-sievestorage: defines a storage for the sieve scripts (a bit crude)
managesieve-login: the initial login daemon (derived from src/imap-login)
managesieve: the actual managesieve daemon (derived form src/imap)
lib-cmusieve: wrapper around dovecot-sieve-1.x to give the old sieve
  implementation an identical interface as the new library. This makes 
  the choice for a specific implementation arbitrary and the transition to
  the new version a seemless process. 

This package currently still requires the dovecot tree to be patched to add
support for the new managesieve daemons. For dovecot-1.0 (<= v9), the 
contents of this package was included in the patch, but now the managesieve 
implementation is separated from the changes in the dovecot tree. Eventually 
the need for the patch will disappear when Timo adds support for defining 
arbitrary new services.

The daemon currently implements all existing MANAGESIEVE commands except the 
HAVESPACE command which always says 'ok'. It also implements the required
support for UTF-8 strings.

This package is partly based on and built for the Dovecot Secure 
IMAP server written by Timo Sirainen <tss@iki.fi>. The managesieve
service is a modified version of Dovecot's imap service 
implementation.

Currently depends on the CMU Sieve implementation located in the
dovecot-sieve package. The AUTHORS file there references the CMU
authors.

TODO
------------

* Implement new script name rules
* Enforce protocol syntax better with some of the commands. Some 
  commands still allow spurious extra arguments
  --> Full protocol syntax conformance review. 
* Implement proper support for anonymous login.
* Implement listing of NOTIFY capability as specified in the latest versions
  of the MANAGESIEVE draft.
* Implement the HAVESPACE command properly. Currently it always says ok.
  Maybe this should be linked to the mail quota system that is currently 
  developed. 
* Create proper process interface to dovecot for generic non-mail protocols 
  (Timo).
* Resolve exessive code duplication
* Make the sieve storage a base class with (possibly) various 
  implementations, just like mail-storage. Currently not very useful. 

* Thorough testing...

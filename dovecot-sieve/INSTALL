Compiling
---------

Use --with-dovecot=<path> to point to dovecot-config file's directory.
There are two possibilities where this could exist:

1) If you configured Dovecot with --enable-header-install, you'll have
dovecot-config installed in $prefix/lib/dovecot/ directory.

2) Compiled Dovecot sources' root directory.

So for example:

./configure --with-dovecot=/usr/local/lib/dovecot
make
sudo make install

sievec and sieved binaries are built only if you use 2) method, because
they need to link with Dovecot's libraries. They can be used to compile and
decompile Sieve scripts. You probably don't need these.

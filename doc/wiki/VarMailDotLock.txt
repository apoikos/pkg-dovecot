---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: open(/var/mail/user.lock) failed: Permission denied
Error: file_lock_dotlock() failed with mbox file /var/mail/user: Permission
denied
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

or with 1.0-stable/test releases:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
open(/var/spool/mail/.temp.host.1234.abcdefg) failed: Permission denied
file_lock_dotlock() failed with mbox file /var/spool/mail/user: Permission
denied
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since v0.99.10.9 it's possible to fix this by adding to config file:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
mail_extra_groups = mail
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

or whatever group owns your /var/mail directory. Keeping sticky bit ('chmod
+t') for /var/mail might still be a good idea for extra security.

SELinux
=======

If the above didn't help, it could have been caused by SELinux permissions. Try
if disabling it helps.

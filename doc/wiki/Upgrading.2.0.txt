Upgrading Dovecot v1.2 to v2.0
==============================

A lot of settings have changed. Dovecot v2.0 can still use most of the v1.x
configuration files, but it logs a lot of warnings at startup. A quick and easy
way to convert your old config file to v2.0 format is:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
doveconf -n -c dovecot-1.conf > dovecot-2.conf
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other important changes:

 * no more convert plugin, use <dsync> [Tools.dsync.txt] instead
 * no more expire-tool, use <doveadm expunge> [Plugins.Expire.txt] instead.
   also expire configuration is different.
 * <Post-login scripts are configured differently> [PostLoginScripting.txt] and
   need to be modified
 * <Quota warnings are configured differently> [Quota.Configuration.txt] and
   the script may need to be modified (most environment settings like $USER are
   gone)
 * Global ACL filenames now require namespace prefix (e.g. if you use "INBOX."
   prefix,'/etc/acls/foo' needs to be renamed to '/etc/acls/INBOX.foo'
 * Maildir: Permissions for newly created mail files are no longed copied from
   dovecot-shared file, but instead from the mail directory

LDA
---

 * deliver binary was renamed to dovecot-lda (but a symlink still exists)
 * -n parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autocreate setting
 * -s parameter was replaced by lda_mailbox_autosubscribe setting

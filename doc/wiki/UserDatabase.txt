User Databases
==============

Dovecot obtains a user's <UNIX user ID (UID), UNIX group ID (GID)>
[UserIds.txt], home directory and<mail location> [MailLocation.txt] from the
user database after the user has been authenticated. The user database may also
return<extra fields> [UserDatabase.ExtraFields.txt] which are sent to the
IMAP/POP3 process in environment variables.

The user and password databases may be the same or they may be different
depending on your needs. You can also have<multiple databases>
[Authentication.MultipleDatabases.txt].

For more information about UID and GID, see <UserIds.txt>.

For more information about home directory and mail location, see
<MailLocation.txt>.

   'getpwnam()' function)

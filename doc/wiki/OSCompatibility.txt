Operating System Compatibility
==============================

Dovecot is commonly used with Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Mac
OS X. The following operating systems have also worked at least at some point
in Dovecot's existence:

 * BSD/OS 4.2
 * AIX 4.3
 * HP-UX 11.11
 * Tru64 ?.?
 * <UnixWare.txt> 7.1.4
 * IRIX 6.5 compiles, but SCM_RIGHTS seems to be broken.
 * Cygwin works after a few code changes, but doesn't support SCM_RIGHTS.

There is one slightly problematic feature that Dovecot requires: *SCM_RIGHTS.*
It is used for privilege separation. If it is not supported, you can still use
inetd and mailfront [http://untroubled.org/mailfront/], which executes
Dovecot's IMAP or POP3 binary.

Compilers
---------

Dovecot should compile with any ANSI-C99 compiler. Dovecot has been known to
compile (at least once in its lifetime) with the following compilers:

 * GCC
 * Intel CC [http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/clin/]
 * Tiny CC [http://www.tinycc.org]
 * Sun Studio 11
 * AIX xlC
 * HP-UX cc

Operating System Compatibility
==============================

There is one slightly problematic feature that Dovecot requires: *SCM_RIGHTS.*
It is used for privilege separation. If it is not supported, you can still use
inetd and mailfront [http://untroubled.org/mailfront/], which executes
Dovecot's IMAP or POP3 binary.

Dovecot should compile with any ANSI-C99 compiler. Besides GCC, Dovecot is
known to compile (at least once in its lifetime:) with Intel CC
[http://www.intel.com/software/products/compilers/clin/], Tiny CC

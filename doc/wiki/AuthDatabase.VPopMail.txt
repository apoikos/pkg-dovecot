VPopMail
========

This is an external software intended to make handling virtual domains easier.
Supports Qmail and Postfix. See http://inter7.com/vpopmail.html

If the vpopmail database contains plaintext passwords, it can be used for
non-plaintext authentication as well.

You can use auth_cache with VPopMail if you give 'cache_key' parameter. See

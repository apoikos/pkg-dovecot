Dovecot ManageSieve Server
==========================

ManageSieve service is used to manage a user's <Sieve> [LDA.Sieve.txt] script
collection. It has the following advantages over doing it directly via
filesystem:

 * No need to let users log in via FTP/SFTP/etc, which could be difficult
   especially with virtual users.
 * ManageSieve is a standard protocol
   [http://tools.ietf.org/rfcmarkup?rfc-repository=http://www.rfc-editor.org/authors&doc=rfc5804&topmenu=true&document=draft-ietf-sieve-managesieve-09&docreplaces=draft-ietf-sieve-managesieve-09&title=RFC-EDITOR+AUTH48+REVIEW+COPY&extrastyle=body+{background-color:#fee;}]
   (almost finalized, and unlike to have any major changes), so users can
   manage their scripts using (hopefully) user-friendlyManageSieve clients.
   Many webmails already include aManageSieve client.
 * Scripts are compiled before they are installed, which guarantees that the
   uploaded script is valid. This prevents a user from inadvertently installing
   a broken Sieve script.

Dovecot's ManageSieve support is distributed in a separate package. Currently
it also requires patching Dovecot sources, but this won't be necessary anymore
in Dovecot v2.0. Dovecot'sManageSieve implementation is part of the Pigeonhole
project [http://pigeonhole.dovecot.org/]. There exists also an alternative
pysieved [http://gitorious.org/pysieved/pages/Home] ManageSieve server that
works with Dovecot.

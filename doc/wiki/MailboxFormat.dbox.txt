dbox
====

Introduced with Dovecot 1.0a4. The point is to have a high performance mail
store combining all the best qualities of other mailbox formats. Some behavior
can't be universally accepted as optimal, so dbox allows sysadmin to configure
those:

 * One mail per file, or multiple mails per file? If multiple,
    * How large each file can grow? This is a tradeoff between read and expunge
      performance.
    * How old files do we still append new mails to? Helps with incremental
      backups.
 * How often should changed mail metadata (flags and keywords) be written to
   dbox files, instead of only in Dovecot's index files? This is a tradeoff
   between reliability and performance.

dbox format isn't finished yet, so it should only be used for testing purposes.

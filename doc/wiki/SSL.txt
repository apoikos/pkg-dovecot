 * <Creating SSL certificates> [SSL.CertificateCreation.txt]
 * <Configuring Dovecot to use SSL certificates> [SSL.DovecotConfiguration.txt]

 * <Importing CAs and self-signed SSL certificates to clients>
   [SSL.CertificateClientImporting.txt]
 * SSL works pretty much the same universally, so for more information about
   SSL you can see for example Apache's documentation
   [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/].
 * Dovecot uses OpenSSL, so whatever information you find about it applies also

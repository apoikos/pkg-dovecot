Shared mailboxes
================

Dovecot can support mailbox sharing in several different ways:

 * <Public mailboxes> [SharedMailboxes.Public.txt]
 * <Shared mailboxes> [SharedMailboxes.Shared.txt] between users (using IMAP
   ACL commands) (v1.2+)
 * <Symlinking mailboxes> [SharedMailboxes.Symlinks.txt]

See <SharedMailboxes.Permissions.txt> for common filesystem related permission
problems that are common with all the sharing methods.

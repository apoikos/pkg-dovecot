Proxying
========

Dovecot supports proxying IMAP and POP3 connections to other hosts. The
proxying can be done for all users, or only for some specific users. There are
two ways to do the authentication:

 1. Forward the password to the remote server and let it perform the actual
    authentication. This requires that the client uses only plaintext
    authentication.
 2. Let Dovecot proxy perform the authentication and login to remote server
    using the proxy's <master password> [MasterPassword.txt]. This allows
    client to use also non-plaintext authentication.

The proxy is configured pretty much the same way as <login referrals>
[PasswordDatabase.ExtraFields.Host.txt], with the addition of 'proxy' field.
The common fields to use for both proxying ways are:

 * 'proxy' and 'proxy_maybe': Enables the proxying. Either one of these fields
   is required.
    * 'proxy_maybe' can be used to implement "automatic proxying". If the proxy
      destination matches the current connection, the user gets logged in
      normally instead of being proxied. If the same happens with 'proxy', the
      login fails with "Proxying loops" error. This feature exists only in
      v1.1+.
 * 'host=s': The destination server's *IP address*. This field is required.
   Note that currently it's required to use an IP address since no DNS
   resolving is done. (DNS resolution proposal: look <here>
   [PasswordDatabase.ExtraFields.Proxy.HostLookup.txt])
 * 'port=s': The destination server's port. The default is 143 with IMAP and
   110 with POP3.
 * 'destuser=s': Tell client to use a different username when logging in.
 * 'proxy_timeout': Abort connection after this many seconds. (v1.2.4+)

In v1.2.rc4+ the connections to destination server can be TLS/SSL encrypted by
returning:

 * ssl=yes: Use SSL and require a valid verified remote certificate. *WARNING:
   Unless used carefully, this is an insecure setting!* Currently host must be
   an IP address, so this setting accepts any certificate signed by a trusted
   CA. The host name isn't checked in any way against the certificate's CN. The
   only way to use this securely is to only use and allow your own private CA's
   certs, anything else is exploitable by a man-in-the-middle attack.
 * ssl=any-cert: Use SSL, but don't require a valid remote certificate.
 * starttls: Use STARTTLS command instead of doing SSL handshake immediately
   after connected.
    * With v2.0+ you can use "starttls=any-cert". With older versions you need
      to specify both "ssl=any-cert" and "starttls".

The destination servers don't need to be running Dovecot, but you should make
sure that the Dovecot proxy doesn't advertise more capabilities than the
destination server can handle. For IMAP you can do this by changing
'imap_capability' setting. For POP3 you'll have to modify Dovecot's sources for
now ('src/pop3/capability.h'). v1.2.rc4+ automatically sends updated untagged
CAPABILITY reply if it detects that the remote server has different
capabilities than what it already advertised to the client. Note that some
clients simply ignore the updated CAPABILITY reply.

Password forwarding
-------------------

Make sure that the authentication succeeds with any given password. You can do
this by using empty passwords. v1.1+ requires also that you return 'nopassword'
field.

Master password
---------------

This way of forwarding requires the destination server to support master user
feature. The users will be normally authenticated in the proxy and the common
proxy fields are returned, but you'll need to return two fields specially:

 * 'destuser=s': Both the logging username and the master username need to be
   included in this.
 * 'pass=s': This field contains the master user's password.

For the master user logins it'd be cleaner to use a SASL mechanism with
authorization ID, but for now this isn't supported.

If the destination server is Dovecot, you can return these fields like:

 * 'destuser=%u*proxy'
 * 'pass=secret'

Then in the destination Dovecot's config file set
'auth_master_user_separator=*' and create a master user named *proxy* with
password *secret*. See <MasterPassword.txt> for more information how to
configure this.

Example password forwarding SQL configuration
---------------------------------------------

Create the SQL table:

---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE proxy (
  user varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  host varchar(16) default NULL,
  destuser varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (user)
);
---%<-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert data to SQL corresponding your users.

Working data could look like this:
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| user | host        | destuser        |
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| john | 192.168.0.1 |                 |
+------+-------------+-----------------+
| joe  | 192.168.0.2 | joe@example.com |
+------+-------------+-----------------+

Why doesn't Dovecot work?
=========================

 * Make sure you're looking at the correct log files. Debug messages may be
   written to a different log file than error messages. See<Logging.txt>.
 * Try logging in manually by sending IMAP commands. If you're trying with an
   IMAP client you can't be sure if the problem is with the client's
   configuration or Dovecot's configuration. See<TestInstallation.txt> (or
   <TestPop3Installation.txt>).

It says password mismatch
-------------------------

If you're using PAM:

 * Make sure that dovecot-auth is running as root (assuming it's using
   '/etc/shadow').
 * PAM errors aren't written to Dovecot's own logs. Usually they go to
   '/var/log/auth.log' or something similar.
    * Unfortunately PAM's error messages aren't always all that helpful in
      figuring out what exactly the problem is.
 * Usually the problem is that you don't have a correctly named file in
   '/etc/pam.d/'. See <PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt>

For non-PAM set 'auth_debug_passwords=yes' and look at what it says in the
logs. If it's trying to use a wrong password scheme, you can change that.

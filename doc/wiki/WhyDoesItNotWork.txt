Why doesn't Dovecot work?
=========================

 * *Dovecot always logs an error message* if anything goes wrong, so make sure
   you're looking at the correct log files. Debug messages may be written to a
   different log file than error messages. See<Logging.txt>.
 * Try logging in manually by sending IMAP commands. If you're trying with an
   IMAP client you can't be sure if the problem is with the client's
   configuration or Dovecot's configuration. See<TestInstallation.txt> (or
   <TestPop3Installation.txt>).
 * Are you using an older version than v1.0? RHEL 5 and Debian Etch distribute
   v1.0.rc15, and there has been a LOT of fixes since then. If you have a
   problem, see if NEWS [http://dovecot.org/doc/NEWS] file mentions anything
   related to it.

It says password mismatch
-------------------------

If you're using PAM:

 * Make sure that dovecot-auth is running as root (assuming it's using
   '/etc/shadow').
 * PAM errors aren't written to Dovecot's own logs. Usually they go to
   '/var/log/auth.log' or something similar.
    * Unfortunately PAM's error messages aren't always all that helpful in
      figuring out what exactly the problem is.
 * Usually the problem is that you don't have a correctly named file in
   '/etc/pam.d/'. See <PasswordDatabase.PAM.txt>

For non-PAM set 'auth_debug_passwords=yes' and look at what it says in the
logs. If it's trying to use a wrong password scheme, you can change that.
See<Authentication.PasswordSchemes.txt>
